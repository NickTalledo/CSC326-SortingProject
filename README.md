# Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project

The Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project is a collaborative effort involving a group of three individuals. The objective of this project was to analyze and compare various sorting algorithms by measuring the average microseconds taken to sort arrays. The project involved testing popular sorting algorithms such as merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, heap sort, selection sort, and quick sort.

## Objective

The primary objective of the Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project was to gain insights into the performance of different sorting algorithms. By measuring the execution time and number of steps taken by each algorithm, the project aimed to identify the most efficient sorting algorithms for different scenarios.

## Features

- **Algorithm Testing:** The project involved implementing and testing six sorting algorithms: merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, heap sort, selection sort, and quick sort.

- **Time Measurement:** The execution time of each sorting algorithm was measured in microseconds to assess their efficiency in sorting arrays of various sizes.

- **Step Counting:** The number of steps taken by each algorithm during the sorting process was recorded to analyze the algorithm's behavior.

- **Data Presentation:** The collected data was compiled and presented in visual formats, such as graphs and tables, to facilitate easy comparison and interpretation.

## Collaborative Approach

- **Group Collaboration:** The project was undertaken collaboratively by a group of three individuals, each contributing to different aspects of the project.

- **Code Review:** Code reviews were conducted to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the sorting algorithms' implementations.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run the sorting algorithm implementations on different arrays of numbers to measure execution time and step counts.
4. Analyze the collected data and visualize the results for comparisons.

## Contribution

If you find areas for improvement or want to extend the project, feel free to contribute by suggesting enhancements, adding new algorithms, or refining the data presentation methods.

## Conclusion

The Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project demonstrates the collaborative effort of analyzing and comparing various sorting algorithms. By measuring execution time and step counts, the project provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics of different sorting algorithms, aiding in informed algorithm selection for specific scenarios.
